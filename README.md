# PLAN

- update fonts
- update header icon and border and top

- change index page design
    - remove add cart and counter from front page
    - change counter style to use `<select>` instead for `<input>`
    - show only 3 cards per row and the gap should equal to the `inline-padding` of the section
    - each page should have a introduction section
    - fonts: style script and fira sans
    - header should stick add `top: 0`
    - use icon in cart page button
    - use light dark color for fonts
    - get a better primary color

- cart page design
    - fix overflow due to name
    - make price as position sticky or fixed
    - maybe add a buy button
- refactor: design similar to (brooklinen)[https://www.brooklinen.com/]
